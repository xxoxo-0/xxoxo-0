(To those who are interested ABOUT getting to know me a bit. /srs)

- ☁️ ┆ 〖 ' Multi-Fandom guy/dude! ┆ ╮ 〗

Fandom that I mostly like :
- 『 彡 ┆ ☁️ ᯓ *Black Butler, Castlevania, Welcome Home, Threadville, High rise invasion, Honkai Star Rail, Pressure (from roblox), and A LOT more.* ┆╰ 』

Stuffs that I ***DON'T*** like. :
- *$3xual J0KES, P3d0 j0k3s, Problematic People, Forcing abt smth, pr0-SH1PP3R, Over-Sarcasm, Interacting when upset, Tracing arts/my arts etc, COPY/INSPO 1-of my skins on pt, Calling names that aren't close/friends.*

Random note :
- ... Wondering why my skins from pt are mostly red/brown? Ts because their my fav colors :D!

〖 ☁️ ᯓ ┆ Mostly go all alone by myself. I don't mind chatting w *other* friends and a stranger I guess, *Socially awkward and will keep silent. (if ur w someone)* 彡┆〗

Some random fun fact abt me (again)
- Gregory Violet is my kin, My personality were close to him for being Gothic, artistic!
