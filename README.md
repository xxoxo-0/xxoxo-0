________________________________

☁️ ┊ " An average & unknown artist , cough ignore with the headcanon thing. Anyway, Here's about me! :

(To those who are interested ABOUT getting to know me a bit. /srs)

- 〖 彡 | _ ɴᴀᴍᴇ's *Calzy Novien* ! ʏᴏᴜ ᴄᴀɴ ᴄᴀʟʟ ᴍᴇ *Nov or Caz* ғᴏʀ sʜᴏʀᴛ, ɪғ ʏᴏᴜ'ᴅ ᴘʀᴇғᴇʀʀᴇᴅ ᴏɴʟʏ.

- 〖 ┊ ╰ ➤ Pronounciations... ʜᴇ/ʜɪᴍ - ᴛʜᴇʏ/ᴛʜᴇᴍ . ┊ 〗

- ☁️ ┆ 〖 ' Multi-Fandom guy/dude! ┆ ╮ 〗

Fandom that I mostly like :
- 『 彡 ┆ ☁️ ᯓ *Black Butler, Castlevania, Nanbaka, Welcome Home, Threadville, High rise invasion, Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Cookie run Kingdom, Pressure (from roblox), and A LOT more.* ┆╰ 』

Stuffs that I ***DON'T*** like. :
- *$3xual J0KES, P3d0 j0k3s, Problematic People, Forcing abt smth, pr0-SH1PP3R, Over-Sarcasm, Interacting when upset, COPYING 1-of my skins on pt, Calling names that aren't close/friends.*

Random note :
- ... Wondering why my skins from pt are mostly red/green & brown? That's because their my fav colors :D!

〖 ☁️ ᯓ Mostly goes to play all by myself. I don't mind chatting w friends or even add me! I'm friendly and might be also awkward sometimes (#´Д`) 彡┆〗

(Update: apparently I have social anxiety, forgive me if I'm too shy or quiet.)

Some random fun fact abt me (again)
- Idia Shroud is my fictkin! His and I have the almost same personality.
